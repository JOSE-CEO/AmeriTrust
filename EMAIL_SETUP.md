## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication failed"**
- Double-check your username and password
- For Gmail, ensure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
- Verify 2FA is enabled for Gmail

**"Connection timeout"**
- Check your SMTP_HOST and SMTP_PORT settings
- Ensure your server allows outbound connections on port 587
- Try port 465 with secure: true for some providers

**"Email not delivered"**
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify the recipient email address is correct
- Check your email provider's sending limits

### Environment Variables Checklist

- [ ] SMTP_HOST is correct for your provider
- [ ] SMTP_PORT is correct (usually 587 or 465)
- [ ] SMTP_USER is your full email address
- [ ] SMTP_PASS is correct (App Password for Gmail)
- [ ] SMTP_FROM is properly formatted

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- Use App Passwords instead of regular passwords when available
- Consider using a dedicated email account for system notifications
- Regularly rotate your email passwords

## Production Deployment

For production deployment on Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add all SMTP_* variables with their production values
4. Redeploy your application

The email system will automatically use these environment variables in production.
